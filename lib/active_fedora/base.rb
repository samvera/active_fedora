module ActiveFedora
  # This class ties together many of the lower-level modules, and
  # implements something akin to an ActiveRecord-alike interface to
  # fedora. If you want to represent a fedora object in the ruby
  # space, this is the class you want to extend.
  #
  # =The Basics
  #   class Oralhistory < ActiveFedora::Base
  #     property :creator, predicate: RDF::Vocab::DC.creator
  #   end
  #
  # The above example creates a Fedora object with a property named "creator"
  #
  # Attached files defined with +has_subresource+ and iis accessed via the +attached_files+ member hash.

3.1.0
Based on rubydora for fedora interface
RDF-xml for the relationships

3.0.4

HYDRA-663 -- Passing an empty string to a id setter should clear the belongs to association

3.0.3

Added HasAndBelongsToManyAssociation

3.0.2

YANKED


3.0.1

HYDRA-654 -- Fixed reification using has_model as the class instead of active_fedora_model

3.0.0

added belongs_to and has_many model relationships
added nested_attributes_for
Added dependency on rails > 3.0.0

2.3.7 

HYDRA-650 -- Fixed relationship inheritance (Rick Johnson)

2.3.6

YANKED
Removed Bundler.require, which was causing odd dependency order resolving.

2.3.5 

YANKED
branched so that trunk now require rails 3.
Named finders HYDRA-541 (Rick Johnson)

2.3.4

moved dirty assignment to NokogiriDatastream#update_values; added test (Benjamin Armintor)
Fixed HYDRA-590

2.1.0

HYDRUS-151: Base.update_datastream_attributes now relies on update_indexed_attributes instead of update_attributes.  This makes it easier to support non-javascript forms (and makes update_datastream_attributes worth using).

2.0.4 

collection_members_append now returns self.

2.0.3

HYHULL-25: tweaking ContentModel to ignore namespace

2.0.2

Fixed activeresource requirement in specfile
Switched Bundler to rely on specfile for runtime dependencies.

2.0.1

Made Gemfile agnostic about Rails version (dependency on activeresource)

2.0.0

Upgraded to use solrizer 1.0.0, which uses RSolr instead of the outdated ruby-solr:

  All solrize and extract methods now accept and return a _Hash_ rather than a Solr::Document
  As part of this switch, *all field names are stored as Strings, not Symbols*. If you previously accessed something as solr_doc[:title_t], now you need to access it as solr_doc["title_t"]

1.2.9
Minor: Fixed Gemfile to require activeresource <3.0.0 NOT >3.0.0

1.2.6

Requires Solrizer 0.3.0 or higher

HYDRA-274 Configurable Facets
HYDRA-275 Update ActiveFedora to use Solrizer::XML::TermBasedSolrizer when indexing NokogiriDatastreams

1.2.5 -- botched version release

1.2.4

Bug: Base.file_objects_append wasn't saving the child object after modifying its RELS-EXT

1.2.3

Major: Switched flow of relationship assertions for file objects. Now children assert isPartOf rather than parents asserting hasCollectionMember (see HYDRA-70 and HYDRA-71)

New class method: ActiveFedora::Base#has_bidirectional_relationship creates relationship finder methods that search across bidirectional relationships (ie. finds all of the object's hasPart assertions as well as any objects pointing at it with isPartOf)

Feature: Fedora::Connection now returns the Fedora error in any ServerError messages

Documentation: Added RDoc code comments for experimental features from version 1.2

Bug: MetadataDatastream.update_indexed_attributes doesn't get tripped up by attribute names wrapped in arrays (previously wrapping the symbol in an array would cause an error

Bug: Applied some fixes to usage of URIs in SemanticNode

1.2.2

Misc bug fixes

1.2.1

TERMPORARY: removed solrizer from gem dependency list (cyclic reference breaks bundler) 

1.2

Now support using OM::XML::Terminologies in NokogiriDatastreams

resolved #504 -- Allow SSL certificate client authentication for connections to Fedora 

Added Experimental methods for has_datastream, named_datastream, and remove_relationship (contributed by Rick Johnson at Notre Dame)

1.1.13

MetadataDatastream.update_indexed_attributes was no longer marking the object dirty when triggered.  Resulted in changed datastreams not saving.  Fixed now.

1.1.12

* Minor fix to Base.get_values_from_datstream (wasn't returning default values when necessary)

1.1.11

* fix to update_index preventing double-metadata
* now nokogiri datastreams initialize with default template.

1.1.8

solrizer fix to ensure that Nokogiri Datastreams are included in Base.to_solr

1.1.7 

Nokogiri Datastream support using Nokogiri and OM::XML.  Includes indexing of xml contents into solr based on accessors declared using OM::XML:Accessor module.
You now have the option of calling has_metadata without passing in a block


1.1.6

Bug #959: Base.delete fails to delete objects from Solr even when ENABLE_SOLR_UPDATES == true

1.1.5

Feature: Base.save triggers Solrizer if you've required the gem in your app 

1.1.2 

Bug: Model.find_by_solr fails when you pass it an argument of :all
Testing: Updated RSpec tests to run against localhost:8983 with Fedora 3.3 (instead of localhost:8080 with Fedora 3.2).  This means you can use a copy of hydra-jetty from http://github.com/hydraproject/hydra-jetty
Testing: Reduced the amount of noise output to the shell during tests

1.1.1 2010-03-22

Bug: .load_objects wipes out datastream attributes from model-defined datastreams (ie. label and mimeType)

1.1.0 2010-03-20

Feature #822: Export & Ingest Fedora Objects

1.0.9 2010-03-10

!! Requires a new Solr schema by default.  We recommend updating solr with the schema.xml located at http://bitbucket.org/mediashelf/active_fedora/src/tip/solr/config/schema.xml.  If you want to keep using the old schema.xml, you must save the solr mappings file from http://bitbucket.org/mediashelf/active_fedora/src/tip/config/solr_mappings_af_0.1.yml as config/solr_mappings.yml in your application(s).

Bundled ruby-fedora into active-fedora, removing external gem dependency

Field names now map to solr field names using solr_mappings.yml.  You can put your own into RAILS_ROOT/config/solr_mappings.yml or rely on the default within the gem.  

* Bug #552: Model relationship should be asserted using hasModel instead of conformsTo
* Bug #614: Datastream should have mime_type accessors
* Bug #692: Datastream.new should allow you to use :mime_type as an argument instead of :mimeType
* Feature #430: YAML-based config files for Fedora Repository and SolrService
* Feature #475: Ability to perform XUpdate-style partial updates of XML metadata
* Feature #753: Configurable Solr Field Names
* Feature #807: update_indexed_attributes should return the new index for any added values

1.0.7 2009-09-18

Performance improvements. Requires RubyFedora 1.0.7 (but will probably work with 1.0.5)

Feature #489: Optimize datastreams method so that you only hit fedora and parse xml when you have to
Bug #415: Base.save returns meaningful responses and yields exceptions when appropriate
Bug #465: ActiveFedora::Base#fields method performance issues (tied to #489)


1.0.6 2009-08-27

Minor update.

* ToDo #78: Relationship finders should return an array of ActiveFedora Objects
* Bug #40: Fedora::Datastream should track control_group attribute correctly
* Bug #425: SOLR_DOCUMENT_ID still hardcoded as "id" in a few spots
* Bug #449: using has_metadata breaks support for custom pids

1.0.5 2009-07-17

Minor update.

* Bug #387: Base.deserialize should mark all datastreams as not new
* ToDo #389: Base.update_attributes and Base.update_indexed_attributes should accept :datastream limiter
* Feature #388: Base.update_attributes and Base.update_indexed_attributes should support deleting fields

1.0.4 2009-07-10

!! Not Backwards Compatible with Fedora < 3.2.* !!

* 1 major enhancement:
  * ruby-fedora is now compatible with Fedora 3.2.1
  
Changelog:
* ToDo #272: Datastream.new should accept a :prefix option for auto-incrementing DSIDs

* ToDo #318: Intelligent FileDatastream and FileAsset Management
* Bug #312: Base.delete should delete the solr record as well as the Fedora Object
* Feature #46: Improve OSX Fedora/Solr Disk Image
* Feature #284: solr document id should by a config option instead of hard coded as "id"
* Feature #307: ActiveFedora::Base should provide a label setter.
* Feature #314: Relationship finder should provide a "response_format" option, default to format of "objects"
* Feature #327: Option to turn off solr updates (assume that something else will update Solr for you)
